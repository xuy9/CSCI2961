##Part 2.
 It is important to choose a License beacuse it tells people how to use one's code and what are they allowed to do with one's code.
 Choosing a License distibute the resposibilities of both the Licensor's and of the users'. Therefore licensing protects the right of
 the one's interlectual property.
 
##Part 3.
 Because without a explict license basically means that the author reserves all rights to the project. Since the author's intention regarding usage of his or her project is unclear, one should not just use the project. If one use the project anyway, one is using the program without permission and is violating the author's rights.

##Part 4.
 I agree with the author on his claim of why Web beat Gopher. After reading the history of development and resource of Gopher and Web, i think that the defeat of Gopher is inevitable. On a technical level, Gopher not only does not support more user-efficient model as Web does  hypertext, but also it's interface is technically inferior to Web's interface Mosaic. I think that the technical inferiority is already a major kill for Gopher, let along it's bad social publicity and lesser institutional influences. In this case of Gopher vs Web, Web clearly has overwhelming advantages over Gopher and Gopher itself has many limits, both of which eventually lead to the failure of Gopher. 

##Part 5.
 The reason for Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2 is that this license not only promotes the third-party to
 contribute on developing it's Linux-based platform but also allows companies to invest and profit on the proprietary enhancements. ASL
 license make it possible to use open-source software code without the condition of having to turn proprietary enhancements back over to the open source software community. The ASL license will attract more companies to use the Android platform because companies can keep their proprietary technologies.

##Part 7.
 For a developer Apache/BSD license is better because with this license a developer can use patent claim to protect his intellectual property within the open-source condition.
 For a company 
 For the common good, i think the GPL license is better. Because the GPL license is strongly copyleft. It requires all derivative works to be GPL-licensed, which means that the same freedom and rights for everyone. Also under GPL license one must make the source code available for everyone, so that others can study and use it.
