###Short paragraph of what you got out of reading that chapter of Free Culture:

 This chapter is about an RPI student getting suited because his improvement on the quality of search on website somehow 
 violet the copyright law. I was very surprise that he got himself a lawsuit. Because i think what he achieve is very impressive. 
 The fact that he got suited make me more aware of the legal issues and other seemingly irrelevant matters one need to took into
 consideration when trying to create and publish something. Also i think that other than being aware of issues that might cause trouble,
 it is vital that one should also fight for one’s rights. On the other hand, his achievement by tinkering with available resources on 
 the internet encourages me to try to the same. I think i will shortly starting to tinker around through this course. And it is good to 
 be curious and willing to explore. The internet is probably a very powerful tool to get start with, if one wish to explore.
